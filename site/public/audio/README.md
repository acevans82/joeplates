# Audio Files for Music Player

Add your MP3 files here with the following names to match the track IDs:

## Required Files

- `main-mix.mp3` - Default JoePlates house mix (plays when clicking the nav speaker icon)
- `a-night-in-seville.mp3` - A Night in Seville theme
- `tour-de-france.mp3` - Tour de France theme
- `the-faces-of-champagne.mp3` - The Faces of Champagne theme
- `island-heat.mp3` - Island Heat theme
- `ode-to-mushrooms.mp3` - Ode to Mushrooms theme

## How it Works

The music player will:
- Loop each track automatically
- Play at 30% volume (good for background music)
- Smoothly switch between tracks when clicking cards
- Only play when user explicitly clicks play

## File Format

- **Format:** MP3
- **Recommended:** 128-192 kbps (good quality, reasonable file size)
- **Length:** 3-10 minutes recommended (since they loop)

## Personal Use Note

These files are for personal/demo use only. Make sure you have rights to any music you use here.
