I’m sitting in a small hotel cafe in Bordeaux, France with my dear friend, Dave (known to all as Dr. Dave) looking out over the old square, the fountain, the river, sipping on an Armagnac from 1975. It’s one of those moments where there’s not much to say. Life is pretty much perfect. People are moving to and fro and around us like battery operated puzzle pieces, each with a clear picture of their destination. The square maintains a quiet bustle, just busy enough to be entertaining. Dr. Dave and I tip our glasses to each other with a nodding recognition of satisfaction. we talked about this for almost a year, sketched it out over multiple meals and late nights and Google Searches and YouTube vids. It was his dream to come back here and to make all of this happen, right down to the very moment we were sharing. (Dave had a knack for planning down to the micro detail).

I gaze over at my friend, who has become my hero over the time I have known him and take in a deep breath of gratitude. For the last 2+ years I have been Dave’s friend - turned private chef - turned close confidante and adventure co-conspirator - and now, brother. Meanwhile, Dave has a vicious version of cancer. The kind that makes one cringe when it gets called it out. The “oh no, not that one” cancer. 

Cancer aside, Dave and I are a modern model for symbiosis. We love to hike and explore. We love to be surrounded by good people. I’m obsessed with food and cooking and wine - and WOW, CAN HE EAT! Anything, all of it, French, Spanish, German, Thai - and always with an almost ferocious display of gratitude. The celebration of food, wine and camaraderie are our mutual lives’ catharsis and a cornerstone of the cancer defiant bubble we have created - a fantastic bubble filled with good souls, endless gatherings, days on the lake and on wooded trails, late night movies and a constant scheming for adventures and getaways (even when mobility and other hinderances interrupted) - all leading up to this present escape and our current location. And here we sit, savoring.

“Promise me you will keep doing this,” Dave speaks after a long pause.

“Keep doing what?” I reply.

“THIS!, Dave repeats passionately, “THIS! Doing this for people. Food and wine and, you know, all of this “life concierge” stuff. Look at what we have built over the last years. The people, the relationships, the memories, the meals. It’s like a small model for the way people are supposed to live, the way we should celebrate being alive, and with the realization that it doesn’t last forever, that we are just here for a short time. A really short time.”

I look away trying to disguise my eyes that are welling up while processing internally... 

“(Expletive), I scream inside my head, I’m going to miss this guy. He has no clue of his impact on the world and on every human being that encounters him, right down to me. He is a walking model for triumphant living, blazing a trail of gratitude no matter what life’s circumstances have delivered. Only once have I seen frustration take him in almost 3 years and a continuous stream of “healing but not healed” diagnosis”.

Dave continued, 

“And the thing is, you LOVE this,’ It’s like you were born to do this, cook, travel, bring people together, show up like Santa Claus with a big bag of goodies. It just fits you, and it brings so much happiness. I’m serious. Promise me.

I stared ahead pensively letting Dr. Dave’s words saturate. Taking a drink of my Armagnac, I felt it roll down my throat, warm, smooth and velvety with just a slight burn. I returned Dr. Dave’s glance. 

“OK buddy. I will. I promise.”

And so, in the spirit of Dr. Dave, and with a Barbaric Yawp, I’m proud to announce the launch of JoePlates, Inc. I/we are going to bring the world to your table and have insane amounts of fun while doing so. Join me for a meal, join me on the road, or just have your empty glass ready for when I get back.

The alarm goes off at 5 AM, but you're already awake. The cool morning air of Champagne carries something electric—harvest energy that's been building for months.

By the time the sun crests the hills, the pickers are already moving through the rows. These aren't industrial harvesters or seasonal temps rushed through training. These are families who've been doing this for generations, hands that know exactly when a cluster is ready to become something extraordinary.

I spent a week during vendange visiting three grower-producers I've come to know over years of visits. Each one has a philosophy, a signature, a way of coaxing magic from these chalky soils.

At Pierre Péters, Rodolphe walked me through the same parcels his grandfather tended. The Chétillons vineyard, source of one of the most profound Champagnes I've ever tasted. Standing there, watching the careful selection of each cluster, you understand why these bottles are worth seeking out.

The days blur together: morning pickings, afternoon pressings, evening tastings of base wines that won't become drinkable Champagne for years. Lunches are long and wine-soaked, conversations spanning generations of technique and terroir.

What strikes me most is the patience. Everyone here is working on a timeline measured in years, sometimes decades. The grapes picked this morning won't be ready to drink until long after the picker's grandchildren are born.

There's a lesson in that patience. The best things—wines, meals, relationships—can't be rushed. They require care, attention, and the wisdom to know that some things are worth waiting for.

I brought back three cases of grower Champagne, each bottle a piece of that week. When I open them at dinners, I share these stories. The wine always tastes better when you know the hands that made it.

People always ask what I bring back from trips. They expect me to say wine, and yes, there's always wine. But the suitcase holds more than bottles.

From Portugal, there's always salt. Not just any salt—flor de sal from the Algarve, hand-harvested crystals that dissolve on the tongue like a memory of the ocean. I use it to finish dishes, and guests always notice. "What is that?" they ask. It's a story, I tell them. It's a guy named João who's been working the same salt flats his family has tended for four generations.

From Spain, olive oil. The good stuff, the kind that makes you wonder what you've been putting on salads your whole life. It arrives wrapped in clothes to survive the journey, and I dole it out like liquid gold because that's exactly what it is.

From Scotland, there's usually a bottle or two of whisky you can't find anywhere else—single casks, distillery exclusives, the kind of bottles that require showing up in person and knowing someone who knows someone. But there's also shortbread from a tiny bakery in Edinburgh that makes everything else taste like cardboard.

The strangest cargo? Probably the massive wheel of cheese I once transported from a mountain cave in the Pyrenees. Or the hand-thrown ceramics from a village in Portugal that now serve every dinner I cook. Or the copper pan from a market in Seville that's become my go-to for paella.

Each object is a portal. When I pull out that salt, I'm back on the coast watching João work. When I plate on those ceramics, I remember the potter's hands shaping clay while explaining how his grandmother taught him the technique.

This is the secret to what I do: the physical things are vectors for memory and meaning. The wine tastes better because you know where it came from. The dish resonates because the ingredients have stories.

My suitcase is always too heavy coming home. But the weight is worth it. Every ounce represents a moment, a maker, a place that will now live on at your table, in your glass, in the stories you'll tell your friends.

And if you're wondering: yes, I do leave room for one more bottle. There's always one more bottle.
