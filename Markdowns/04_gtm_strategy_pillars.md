# JoePlates GTM Strategy & Pillar Positioning

This document is for internal strategy, advisor conversations, and potential investor or partner decks.

---

## Core Positioning Statement

**JoePlates sits at the intersection of private chef, sommelier, and travel concierge—delivering high-touch, relationship-driven experiences for people who entertain, collect, and travel often.**

He’s not a restaurant. Not a typical travel agent. Not just a wine guy.  
He’s “the guy” you call when you want the night, the trip, or the cellar to be unforgettable and actually you.

## The Three Pillars as a Lifecycle

Pillars:

1. **Private Dining** – Revenue engine & primary acquisition channel  
2. **Collection & Curation** – High-margin, relationship-deepening layer  
3. **Travel** – Brand-defining, high-ARPU, loyalty-anchoring layer

Cycle:

1. **Private Dining** – Guests first experience Joe at a dinner.  
2. **Travel** – That dinner inspires trips; Joe designs or hosts them.  
3. **Collection & Curation** – Bottles and special items from those trips live on in their cellars and homes.  
4. **Repeat** – Members build their years around a rhythm of dinners, trips, and curation.

Key idea: Most people enter through *Private Dining*, then graduate into *Members Only* via Curation and Travel.

## Guests → Members Funnel

### Top of Funnel (Guests)

- Word of mouth (friends at the table)
- Private dinners for executives, founders, and community connectors
- Light social presence (Instagram, travel and table content)
- Occasional appearances at local or partner events

### Middle of Funnel

- Repeat dinners with the same hosts and overlapping guests  
- Travel conversations at the table (“We’ve always wanted to go to ____”)  
- Curation conversations (“We always end up buying the same bottles”)  
- “Travel & Members Waitlist” form capturing intent without heavy friction

### Bottom of Funnel (Members)

- Handpicked outreach to best-fit Guests:
  - Host frequently  
  - Spend consistently  
  - Value relationships and story-driven experiences
- Membership framed around:
  - Priority access to Joe’s calendar  
  - First right of refusal on hosted trips  
  - Inside track on curation and special items  
- Emphasis on “circle you build your year around,” not “status club”.

## Personas & Value Props

### Persona 1: The Host

**Profile**  
Local executive, founder, or couple who entertains often.

**Pain**

- Planning special nights takes time and creative energy they don’t have.  
- They want nights people talk about, not just another dinner.

**Value Prop**  

- “Your go-to person for remarkable nights at home or in private spaces.”  
- Private dining that feels like a one-night-only restaurant with someone you trust.

**Path**  

- First private dinner → repeat dinners → Membership.

### Persona 2: The Collector / Curator

**Profile**  
Wine and spirits enthusiast, or someone with a cellar who wants more intention.

**Pain**  

- Overwhelmed by noise and inconsistent advice.  
- Doesn’t fully trust retail recommendations.  
- Wants a cellar that reflects personal taste and story, not just scores or labels.

**Value Prop**  

- “Fanatical curation grounded in real travel and real producers.”  
- Access + knowledge, not just a list of expensive bottles.

**Path**  

- Private dinner or intro tasting → cellar audit / curation → Membership.

---

### Persona 3: The Traveler / Experience Chaser

**Profile**  
Loves food and travel, wants depth and meaning in trips.

**Pain**  

- Tired of generic itineraries, overhyped restaurants, and tourist traps.  
- Overwhelmed by planning and choosing where to go.  
- Wants a trip that feels like “us,” not a brochure.

**Value Prop**  

- “Travel with a friend who already knows where to go.”  
- Hosted trips or bespoke itineraries designed by someone who cooks, pours, and knows the ground.

**Path**  

- Join Joe’s Travels or Worldwide Dining → ongoing travel + dining → Membership.

## Differentiation vs Alternatives

### Vs. Restaurant Private Dining Rooms

- You control the location, guest list, and vibe completely.  
- One-off, custom menus vs fixed banquet menus.  
- Continuity over time: Joe learns your tastes and evolves with you.

### Vs. Typical Private Chefs

- Travel and curation are part of the DNA, not upsells.  
- Joe is a long-term partner (Member relationship), not just a gig worker.

### Vs. Wine Shops / Online Retailers

- Cellar strategy tied to your life, not inventory turnover.  
- Real relationships with producers, grounded in Joe’s travel and time in-region.

### Vs. Travel Agents / Concierges

- Food, drink, and human experience are the main event.  
- You can literally bring your chef with you or join his trip.

## Pillar-Specific GTM Angles

### Private Dining (Primary GTM Focus)

**Messaging**  

- “From restaurant people to restaurant-quality nights at home.”  
- “Your go-to person for private dinners you’ll still be talking about next year.”

**Channels**  

- Referrals from existing Guests and Members  
- Partnerships with local venues / event spaces / high-end rentals  
- Relationships with wealth managers, family offices, and EA networks  
- Community-based events or collaborations with aligned brands

---

### Collection & Curation

**Messaging**  

- “Let’s build a cellar that feels like you.”  
- “Skip the noise. Start with what you actually enjoy.”

**Channels**  

- Private tastings at home or in small venues  
- Follow-up offers after dinners (“Want help with the bottles we poured tonight?”)  
- Members-only communications and cellar-focused nights

---

### Travel

**Messaging**  

- “Travel with someone who already knows where to go.”  
- “You bring the people. Joe brings the tables and bottles.”

**Channels**

- High-quality photo/video assets from trips (not high volume posting, but high signal)

## Strategic Narrative for Decks

High-level narrative you can drop into a deck slide:

> **JoePlates turns a private chef into a lifelong, multi-pillar relationship.**  
> Guests meet Joe at the table. The best of those Guests become Members. Members build their years around a rhythm of hosted nights, curated bottles, and trips they couldn’t have planned alone.  
>  
> Behind the scenes, Joe’s constant travel and relationships with producers create a flywheel of access, stories, and offerings that competitors can’t easily replicate.

---

## North Star

At the highest level, the brand promise is:

> **Joe brings the world to your table—and sometimes brings you to the world.**

Every touchpoint (copy, offerings, partnerships, social) should reinforce:

- The **rhythm**: Travel → Curate → Dine → Repeat  
- The **roles**: Guests vs Members  
- The **feel**: high-touch, story-driven, non-pretentious, human

If a new idea, feature, or partnership doesn’t support that rhythm and feel, it’s probably not core to JoePlates.
