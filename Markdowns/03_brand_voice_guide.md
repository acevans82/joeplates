# JoePlates Brand Voice Guide

This document defines the “house style” for JoePlates across the website, email, and future content.

## Voice Pillars

1. **Warm Luxury**  
   Feels high-end and intentional, but never stiff. Think a great boutique hotel bar, not a velvet-rope nightclub.

2. **Effortless Expertise**  
   Joe clearly knows his stuff (wine, food, travel, collecting), but never lectures. Expertise shows up through stories, analogies, and thoughtful recommendations—not jargon.

3. **Relatable Host**  
   Joe is the guy in the band, the mentor, the friend who cooks. Copy should consistently feel like he’s standing in the room with you, not on a podium.

4. **Subtle Exclusivity**  
   “Members Only” feels desirable and curated, not elitist. Language emphasizes *fit* and *priority*, not “you’re not worthy.”

5. **Worldly Curiosity**  
   Point-of-view shaped by travel, relationships with producers, and a genuine love of wandering. Curiosity > snobbery.

6. **Gratitude & Generosity**  
   Giving back is woven into the story. People, memories, and moments are always more important than flexing.

## Name Usage Rules

**1. “Joe” (Default)**  

- Use in most narrative and conversational copy.  
- Example: “When Joe travels…” / “Joe will meet you anywhere in the world…”

**2. “Chef Joe” (Authority Moments)**  

- Use in bios, intros, PR-style references, and where we want to explicitly highlight his role and craft.  
- Example: “Chef Joe has cooked in kitchens from Cleveland to Champagne…”  
- Fine in testimonials: “Chef Joe cooked for our retreat in Bordeaux…”

**3. “chef” (Role-only)**  

- Lowercase, used as a role descriptor, not as a nickname.  
- Example: “your chef and guide” or “work directly with your chef on the menu.”  
- Avoid calling him simply “Chef” as a name.

## Sentence Style

- Mostly medium-length sentences with an occasional short punchy line for rhythm.  
- Use contractions: “we’ll”, “you’re”, “doesn’t”.  
- Use sensory language in moderation (taste, sound, smell).  
- Avoid corporate jargon and overly technical language.

**Good example**  
> Joe shows up with the kind of bottles you tell stories about later.

**Bad example**  
> Joe leverages unparalleled synergies between culinary craftsmanship and luxury lifestyle design.

## Word Choices

**Do use**  

- Gather, linger, savor, wander, exhale, anchor, season, rhythm, stories, makers, producers, friends, table, kitchen, cellar, suitcase, journey  
- Private dining, hosted trips, Members, Guests, circle, calendar, itinerary, leg (of a trip), one-of-a-kind, small-production, handpicked, relationships, curation

**Avoid**  

- “VIP package”, “luxury tier”, “elite”, “exclusive access only to the chosen few”  
- Overused foodie words like “elevated” in every paragraph  
- Corporate jargon like “solutions”, “synergies”, “discerning clientele”

---

## Humor & Swearing

- Light, dry humor is welcome; punchlines should not overwhelm sincerity.  
- Joe may swear in person, but on the site keep it clean or extremely minimal.  
- Tone: grown-up, grounded, human—not goofy or snarky.

---

## Photo & Visual Language

- Prefer real photos over stock: real tables, real bottles, Joe actually cooking, guests actually enjoying.  
- Allow a bit of “real life” to show: a drip of sauce, a half-empty glass, a laugh.  
- Travel photos should be grounded: markets, vineyards, streets; not just “generic postcard sunset”.

---

## Guests vs Members Language

- **Guests** → inviting, warm, accessible.  
- **Members** → same warmth, but with a layer of discretion and priority.

Both should feel like they belong in the same world; Members is not a completely different tone, just a slightly more “inner-circle” flavor.

## Sample Voice Snippets

**Homepage hero flavor**  
> From your kitchen table in Cleveland to a hillside vineyard in Champagne, Joe shows up as the friend who also happens to be an obsessive chef, wine geek, and travel guide.

**Members flavor**  
> Membership isn’t about status. It’s about priority: access to Joe’s calendar, his suitcase, and the best seats at the table when the next journey appears.

**Travel flavor**  
> Whether you join him on a leg of his itinerary or bring him along on yours, travel with Joe feels less like a tour and more like visiting a friend who’s already done the homework.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Over-explaining basic luxury cues (the audience already knows what “nice” feels like).  
- Sounding like a tech startup deck (“full-stack experience platform”).  
- Over-indexing on scarcity / exclusivity to the point it feels hostile.  
- Making Joe sound like a distant, untouchable “celebrity chef” instead of a real person.

Keep coming back to this core: **He’s just Joe—relatable, obsessive in the best way, and someone you actually want in the room.**
