Travel → Curate → Dine → Repeat.

**Subheadline**  
Joe travels the world, curates what he finds, and turns it into intimate private dining and unforgettable journeys for the people he calls Guests and Members.

**Body**  
From your kitchen table in Cleveland to a hillside vineyard in Champagne, Joe shows up as the friend who also happens to be an obsessive chef, wine geek, and travel guide. He’s not there to talk down to you. He’s there to cook, pour, and wander alongside you.

### The JoePlates Cycle

**Section title**  
The JoePlates Cycle

**Eyebrow / kicker**  
Private Dining at the Center of It All

**Body copy**  
Most people first meet Joe at the table. A birthday dinner. A client celebration. A “we’ve been meaning to do this for years” night.

From that table, a rhythm starts:

- Joe cooks and pours for you.  
- Those moments inspire the **next trip**.  
- On that trip, he discovers new bottles, ingredients, and ideas.  
- Those finds come back with him and become the next season of dinners and cellars.

Visually, the loop runs:

1. **Private Dining** (top of the circle)  
2. **Travel**  
3. **Collection & Curation**  
4. **Repeat**

**Micro-blurbs for the loop labels**

- **Private Dining** – The pinnacle of the experience: multi-course menus, tailored pairings, and the people you care about around your table.  
- **Travel** – Vineyards, markets, distilleries, and late-night kitchens that feed the next chapter.  
- **Collection & Curation** – Rare bottles and carefully chosen treasures that live with you long after the night ends.  
- **Repeat** – The calendar fills, your collection grows, and the stories keep getting better.

### Guests vs Members

**Subhead**  
Two Ways to Experience JoePlates

**Copy**  

**Guests**  
Guests are always welcome. If you’re planning a celebration or simply want to gather your favorite people around an unforgettable dinner, you can request a private dining date and Joe will help you make it happen. A week’s notice is ideal for special orders and hard-to-find items, but if the calendar lines up, he has a way of pulling off magic on short notice.

**Members**  
For people who entertain, collect, and travel often, there’s a deeper level: **Members Only**. Members get priority access to Joe’s calendar, first right of refusal on limited-seat trips, and a front-row seat to the Travel → Curate → Dine → Repeat cycle all year.

Membership is capped and selective, but not impossible—think more “private airport lounge” than velvet rope. Referrals from existing Members go to the top of the list.

### Pillars Preview

**Section title**  
Explore the Three Pillars

**Intro line**  
Every JoePlates experience lives at the intersection of three pillars. Most of the time, you’ll touch all three—even if you only see one.

#### Card – Private Dining

**Title**  
Private Dining

**Body**  
Joe designs multi-course menus inspired by his travels and cooks them wherever you are—your home, your office, a rented villa, a cabin in the woods. Each course is tailored to your group and paired with wine, spirits, or non-alcoholic options that actually fit your taste, not just a template.

**Link text**  
Discover Private Dining

#### Card – Collection & Curation

**Title**  
Collection & Curation

**Body**  
Whether you’re just getting into wine or your cellar is older than your kids, Joe helps you find, define, or refine your tastes. Through his relationships with small-production producers and trusted partners, he curates bottles and special items from his travels that belong in your world—not gathering dust on a retailer’s shelf.

**Link text**  
Explore Collection & Curation

#### Card – Travel

**Title**  
Travel

**Body**  
Joe doesn’t just travel for himself. He travels for you. Sometimes that means you join him on a leg of his itinerary—what we call **Joe’s Travels**. Other times it means he quietly wanders on your behalf, building a bespoke trip or showing up as your chef and guide in the destination you’ve been dreaming about.

### Signature Experiences / Dining Themes Spotlight

**Section title**  
Signature Dining Themes

**Intro**  
Each dinner is custom, but these themes give you a taste of what’s possible. Every menu is adapted to your tastes, dietary needs, and the stories you want to tell that night.

**Example spotlight cards** (pick 3–5 to use on the homepage):

- **A Night in Seville** – Late-night tapas, bold flavors, and Spanish wines that feel like a stroll through Seville—without leaving your table.  
- **Tour de France** – From Champagne to Bordeaux and beyond, Joe curates a multi-course journey through his favorite regions and producers across France.  
- **Island Heat** – Sun-soaked, rum-kissed menus inspired by Caribbean markets, beachside grills, and smoky late-night bars.  
- **The Faces of Champagne** – An entire dinner built around Champagne—from grower bottles Joe knows personally to unexpected pairings you’ll still talk about next year.  
- **The Highlander** – Wild, rugged flavors and Scotch pairings influenced by Joe’s time in the Highlands and around the fire with locals.

### About JoePlates (Home teaser)

**Section title**  
About JoePlates

**Body copy**  
Joe has lived at least nine lives: touring musician, tech founder, mentor to entrepreneurs, and, through it all, the guy cooking for everyone after hours. Today, JoePlates is where all of that comes together—a high-touch service for people who want more than just a restaurant, a trip, or a bottle.

Ten percent of all revenue goes to organizations providing food and shelter, because a life built around good meals only makes sense if everyone has a seat at the table.

## Private Dining

### Hero

**H1**  
Private Dining, Anywhere You Call Home

**Subheadline**  
From Cleveland high-rises to rented villas and cabins in the woods, Joe brings the world to your table with multi-course menus and pairings inspired by his travels.

**Body**  
You invite the people. Joe brings the rest—ideas, ingredients, bottles, playlists, and the kind of relaxed-but-obsessive energy that makes the night feel effortless for you and unforgettable for everyone else.

**Primary CTA**  
Inquire About a Private Dinner

**Secondary CTA**  
Talk About Membership

---

### Intro

**Section title**  
More Than a Meal

**Copy**  
We don’t just plan great dining events. We curate memorable life moments.

Every dinner begins with a discovery call where Joe gets to know your story, your tastes, and the people around your table. From there, he designs a menu and pairing experience that could only exist for one group on one night—yours.

Vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic? Easy. Intolerances and allergies? Taken seriously. Want to lean into a region or a theme? That’s where Joe lives.

---

### Experience Types

**Section title**  
How You Can Dine with Joe

#### Private Dining Event (2–20+ Guests)

Perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, promotion dinners, holiday gatherings, and “we just want something special” nights.

- Typically 3–5 courses with optional pairings  
- Menus tailored to your preferences and stories  
- Wine, spirits, and non-alcoholic pairings available  
- Larger groups possible with notice

#### Wine Dinners & Tasting Events

Think guided tasting meets dinner party. Joe designs a flight of wines (or spirits), pairs each with a focused small plate or course, and walks your group through what you’re tasting without any of the snobbery.

Great for:

- Teams and client entertainment  
- Birthday “wine school” nights  
- Friends who want to upgrade their palates and collections

#### Worldwide Dining

Sometimes the best place for dinner is somewhere else. If you’re traveling with friends or family, or planning an offsite, retreat, or getaway, Joe can meet you there as your private chef and dining curator.

He’ll work with local markets, producers, and restaurants to design meals in your villa, on your balcony, or wherever you’re staying—and help you experience the destination as if a local friend were showing you around.

#### Cooking Classes & Demonstrations

Want your guests to get their hands dirty? Joe can turn your kitchen into a playful, hands-on workshop—either as the full event or as a pre-dinner warm-up.

From knife skills to a region-specific menu, he’ll tailor the level of complexity and involvement so everyone has fun (and no one feels like they’re back in school).

---

### How It Works

**Section title**  
What It’s Like to Work with Joe

**Step 1 – Discovery Call**  
*You, Joe, and maybe a glass of something.*  
We’ll talk about the occasion, your guests, your tastes, and any non-negotiables (allergies, foods you love or hate, themes you’re drawn to).

**Step 2 – Menu & Pairing Design**  
Joe sketches a menu and pairing direction, then refines it based on your feedback. This is also where he identifies any special sourcing or travel-inspired touches.

**Step 3 – Sourcing & Curation**  
Joe sources ingredients, bottles, and any special items needed to bring the menu to life—sometimes from local partners, sometimes from producers he met on the road.

**Step 4 – Night-of Service**  
Joe and his small team show up early, cook, plate, pour, and clean up so you can actually enjoy your own party.

**Step 5 – Afterglow & Next Steps**  
If you’re curious about cellars, future trips, or becoming a Member, this is where the next chapter starts.

## Collection & Curation

### Hero

**H1**  
Collection & Curation

**Subheadline**  
Fanatical curation from someone who actually travels for this.

**Body**  
Joe helps you find the bottles, producers, and one-of-a-kind pieces that belong in your life—not just in your feed. Whether you’re starting your first cellar or already shopping by allocation, he blends access, taste, and real-world travel to grow a collection that feels like you.

---

### Intro – Fanatical Curators

**Section title**  
“Fanatical Curators,” in Joe’s Words

**Copy**  
We like to say we’re fanatical curators. Translation: we care as much about what *doesn’t* make it into your collection as what does.

Joe listens for what you actually enjoy—styles, producers, regions, moods—then puts his network and travel schedule to work. You end up with bottles you’re excited to open, not just labels you felt pressured to buy.

---

### Wine & Spirits Cellar Curation

**Section title**  
Wine & Spirits Cellar Curation

**Copy**  
Building a cellar is part art, part logistics. Joe handles both.

- Helps you define your taste or refine what you already like  
- Designs a cellar tailored to your style, palate, and goals (drink now vs age; showpieces vs daily drinkers)  
- Taps relationships with domestic and international suppliers and small-production, high-demand producers  
- Sources directly from the right partners so you avoid guesswork and noisy retail markups

We don’t promise “discounts.” We promise **access and alignment**—to the right bottles, from the right places, at the right moments.

---

### Executive Curation

**Section title**  
Executive Curation

**Copy**  
Sometimes the most memorable gifts aren’t on a website—they’re on a side street market in Portugal or tucked away in a small atelier in Spain.

For select Members, Joe keeps an eye out during his travels for one-of-a-kind pieces:

- Locally crafted jewelry  
- Art and objects with a real story  
- Specialty foods or ingredients that need to be hand-carried home

Think of it as having a little space in his suitcase reserved for you, when the right thing appears.

---

### From Trip to Cellar

**Section title**  
From Trip to Cellar

**Copy**  
A simple example:

- Joe spends a week in Champagne and Bordeaux, visiting growers and small producers.  
- He tastes, talks, and listens.  
- A handful of bottles and relationships make the cut.  
- Those show up as curated allocations in your cellar and on your table at future dinners.

Sometimes he even shows up with a box set himself—bottles he selected and carried home because they made him think of you and your guests.

---

### For Whom

**Section title**  
Who This Is For

- New collectors who want to skip the noise and start strong  
- Established collectors ready for a fresh perspective  
- Executives and family offices who entertain often  
- Members who want their cellars and gifts to feel as intentional as their dinners

---

### Curation CTA

**Section title**  
Start or Refine Your Cellar

**Copy**  
Answer a few questions and Joe will suggest a starting point—whether that’s a simple tasting at home, an audit of what you already own, or a roadmap for where your collection could go.

**Form fields**  

- Name  
- Email  
- City  
- Do you currently have a cellar? (Yes/No)  
- If yes, tell us a bit about it.  
- What are you most interested in? (Wine, Spirits, Both, Other)  
- Approximate annual budget range (optional)  
- Are you interested in Membership? (Yes/No)

**Success message**

## Travel

### Hero

**H1**  
Travel with Joe

**Subheadline**  
Joe doesn’t just travel. He wanders for you.

**Body**  
Whether you join him on a leg of his itinerary or bring him along on yours, travel with Joe feels less like a tour and more like visiting a friend who’s already done the homework. He knows which winemakers will actually sit down with you, which markets are worth waking up early for, and how to balance big-ticket experiences with quiet, soulful moments.

---

### Where We Wander

**Section title**  
Where We Wander

**Copy**  
Joe’s calendar shifts season to season, but there are a few regions he returns to again and again.

- Napa & Sonoma – classic California, off-menu experiences, and long lunches  
- New York City – restaurants, rooftop moments, and big city energy

**International examples**

- England & Scotland – London energy, Highland whisky, and rugged coastlines

---

### Travel Formats

**Section title**  
Three Ways to Travel with Joe

#### Join Joe’s Travels (Hosted Trips)

This is Joe’s own itinerary—you’re invited to hop in.

A few times a year, Joe opens up a small number of seats on trips he’s already planning for sourcing, relationships, and exploration. You can join for a night, a leg, or the entire journey, depending on the trip.

Each hosted trip includes:

- At least one private dinner cooked by Joe  
- A curated line-up of local restaurants and bars  
- Tastings and visits specific to the region (vineyards, distilleries, markets)  
- Optional collaborations with local chefs and artisans

Seats are **strictly limited**. Members get first right of refusal and may receive complimentary or discounted dinners during these journeys.

#### Bespoke Travel

Want the trip to be yours from the ground up? Joe works with a network of trusted partners to design fully bespoke travel for you and your group.

You bring:

- The destination (or a short list of maybes)  
- Who’s coming  
- What you’d like the trip to feel like

Joe brings:

- The food and drink roadmap  
- Reservations that actually make sense  
- Experiences that aren’t on page one of a search result

He can stay behind the scenes as your quiet planner or join you in person as your chef and guide.

#### Worldwide Dining (Chef & Guide)

Already booked the house, the flights, and the friends? Bring Joe in as your private chef and culinary guide for part—or all—of your trip.

He’ll:

- Cook in your rental, villa, or cabin  
- Arrange tastings and key restaurant reservations  
- Introduce you to local producers and markets  
- Help you dial in the balance of exploring out and enjoying “home” nights

---

### Joe’s Travels – Upcoming Journeys

**Section title**  
Joe’s Travels: Upcoming Journeys

**Copy**  
Trips change season to season, but to give you a feel, imagine:

- **Champagne Harvest Week + Paris** – grower visits, cellar tastings, Champagne-paired dinners, and a few days in the city.  
- **Highlands & Skye Whisky Trail** – distillery visits, coastal drives, fireplace dinners, and plenty of time to wander.  
- **Portugal from Porto to the Algarve** – port houses, Douro valley views, seafood in Lisbon, and sunsets in the south.

For launch, these can be beautifully designed placeholder cards that Joe can update as real trips are planned.

**Success message**

---

## Members Only

### Hero

**H1**  
Members Only

**Subheadline**  
For people who entertain, collect, and travel often.

**Body**  
The Members Only circle is for the people Joe sees most often—the ones who like to gather their favorite people, host big nights, and say yes to trips that deserve a bottle (or three).

Membership isn’t about status. It’s about **priority**: access to Joe’s calendar, his suitcase, and the best seats at the table when the next journey appears.

---

### What Members Receive

**Section title**  
What Members Receive

**Copy**  
Exact benefits and pricing will evolve, but every membership is built around three promises:

1. **Priority Access to Joe’s Calendar**  
   - First pick of prime dates and seasons for private dinners  
   - Easier access to short-notice evenings when they pop up  

2. **First Right of Refusal on Joe’s Travels**  
   - Early invitations to limited-seat hosted trips  
   - Access to Members-only meals and tastings on those journeys  
   - Occasional complimentary or discounted dinners as part of a trip package  

3. **Inside Track on Curation & Surprises**  
   - Early access to special allocations and small-production bottles  
   - Optional cellar support and strategy sessions  
   - Joe’s eye out for special items during his travels—something that made him think, “Oh, this is so you.”

Thoughtfulness doesn’t scale, and Joe wouldn’t want it to. Surprises aren’t transactional line items—they’re how he says thank you to the Members who are the bedrock of JoePlates.

---

### The Lifecycle

**Section title**  
A Year in the Life of a Member

**Copy**  
Most Members commit to a minimum number of evenings per year—some start with two anchor dinners, others with ten. Between those nights:

- Joe travels and curates  
- You get first look at trips and new ideas  
- Cellars get tuned up  
- Stories keep piling up

Visual: overlay the Travel → Curate → Dine → Repeat cycle with Membership in the center of the circle.

---

### Member Testimonials

**Section title**  
From the People at the Table

**Copy**  
Pull 3–5 testimonials that clearly feel like “Member energy”:

- Long-term curation clients  
- People Joe has traveled and cooked for multiple times  
- Guests who’ve become friends and regulars

Label them as **Member** and emphasize:

- “We build our year around JoePlates events.”  
- “He knows our taste better than we do.”  
- “Trips with Joe feel like traveling with a friend who happens to be a chef, sommelier, and planner.”

## About

### Hero

**H1**  
Nine Lives. One Calling.

**Subheadline**  
Joe’s mission is simple: bring the world to your table.

---

### The Nine Lives Story

**Section title**  
Nine Lives, All Pointing Here

**Copy**  
Joe has done a lot of things that don’t obviously go together—until you’re sitting at his table.

- He’s been a touring guitarist in rock bands, learning how to read a room and build a setlist.  
- He’s built companies and mentored entrepreneurs, obsessed with helping people design lives they actually want.  
- He’s wandered through vineyards, markets, and kitchens around the world, cooking for friends, clients, and strangers who quickly stopped feeling like strangers.

Through every chapter, a pattern kept surfacing: late nights around a table, bottles open, food disappearing, people exhaling and actually connecting. JoePlates is simply what happens when you decide that’s the main thing—and you build a life around it.

---

### The Barbaric Yawp Moment

**Section title**  
The Moment It Became Non-Negotiable

**Copy**  
There’s a night in Bordeaux that Joe will never forget.

He was on a trip with his friend and client Dr. Dave, a man battling a brutal kind of cancer with an almost ridiculous amount of gratitude and appetite. Joe had been his private chef, friend, confidante, and adventure co-conspirator.

Over Armagnac, Dave looked at him and said: *“Keep doing this. Doing this for people. Food, wine, all of this life concierge stuff. Look at what we’ve built—the people, the memories, the way we’re celebrating being alive. Promise me you’ll keep doing it.”*

Joe promised.

JoePlates is him keeping that promise—turning what started as a weekend hobby into an all-consuming passion: cooking, traveling, bringing people together, and giving more people nights that feel like that.

---

### What JoePlates Is Today

**Section title**  
What JoePlates Is Today

**Copy**  
Today, JoePlates is a high-touch service brand for people who want experiences, not transactions.

- Wine and spirits curation grounded in real travel and relationships  
- Travel that trades checklists for connection

From your kitchen to the Highlands, from your cellar to the sea—Joe shows up as the guy you’d invite anyway, who just happens to be very, very good at this.

---

### Giving & Values

**Section title**  
Giving & Values

**Copy**  
A life built around good food and good fortune only makes sense if everyone has a seat at the table.

- 10% of all revenue goes to organizations providing food and shelter.  
- Joe partners with local foundations and nonprofits (more details as partnerships are formalized).  
- When he travels, he looks for ways to support and spotlight communities and makers doing the work on the ground.

**Values**  

- Generosity  
- Curiosity  
- Craftsmanship  
- Connection  
- Gratitude

---

## Stories

### Stories Index

**H1**  
Stories from the Road & the Table

**Intro copy**  
Not every night needs a write-up, and Joe has no interest in living life just to post about it. But some stories ask to be written down—because they explain why JoePlates exists, or they capture something worth remembering.

You’ll find those here.

Example initial stories:

- The Barbaric Yawp and Beginning  
- Notes from Champagne Harvest  
- What I Bring Back in My Suitcase
